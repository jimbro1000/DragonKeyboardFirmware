# USB HID Firmware for Dragon Keyboard #

This project defines the supporting firmware 
and design tool configuration for adding
USB HID support to the replica Dragon Keyboard

## Status ##

The firmware is in an operable state for the
basic standard 53 keys. The additional Ctrl key
works but leads to unplanned behaviour inside
emulators so needs a mechanism to disable it

The Fn key is not behaving as expected in the
latest version of the software
